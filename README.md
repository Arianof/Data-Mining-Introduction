# Data Mining on the Adult Income Dataset

This notebook presents a step-by-step introduction to data mining using the **Adult Income** dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. It was originally created as a project assignment for the **Artificial Intelligence course** taught by **Prof. Mehdi Ghatee** in the **Faculty of Computer Science at Amirkabir University**.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook cosists the following Parts:

1. **Dataset Loading**
   Loading the Adult Income dataset directly from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult). .

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   Performing numerical analysis and visual exploration to understand data structure, distributions, and correlations.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   Handling missing values, removing duplicates, detecting outliers, and preparing features for modeling and etc.

4. **Classifiers**
   Introducing and running several machine learning classifiers such as:

   * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and etc. 

5. **Model Evaluation**
   Assessing model performance using Several Evaluation metrics, including:

   * F1-Score
   * Precision & Recall
   * Confusion Matrix
   * ROC & AUC curves and etc.

and much more!
